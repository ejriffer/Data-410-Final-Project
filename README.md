# Modeling the NHL: Using KPIs to Predict the Outcome of Games

With the recent legalization of sports betting across many states in the US many are looking for statistical ways to beat the odds makers. While more popular betting sports (like football, boxing, and racing) have extremely sophisticated models to try and predict outcomes some smaller sports, such as hockey, do not. So, for my final project I wanted to see if I could create a model to predict the outcome of NHL games based on readily avaliable statistical information. 

## Introduction 

Provide a comprehensive background for your story/research.

## Description of Data

The data that I used for this project comes from the Python libraries of sportsipy and sportsreference. Below are the specific data sets from each library that I imported. 

```
from sportsreference.nhl.teams import Teams
from sportsipy.nhl.roster import Roster
from sportsipy.nhl.roster import Player
from sportsipy.nhl.schedule import Schedule
from sportsipy.nhl.boxscore import Boxscore
```

These libraries contain information about all the the teams, players, and games from the NHL over the last 

## Description of all the methods applied

### Pre-processing methods

### The analytical/machine learning methods 

Consider expanding this section with a lot of details from concepts and theories.

Feel free to add a lot of details.

### The actual application of the methods and the validation procedure

Here you can include flow chart diagrams and describe your coding approach.

Suggestion: make sure you have anough computing power.  (Consider Colab Pro)

## Discussion and inferences

Include your perspective and critical thinking. Comment what seems to be working and identify possible future research.
